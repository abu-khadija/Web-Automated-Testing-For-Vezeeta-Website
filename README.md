Proficiency in Java programming language
Knowledge of TestNG testing framework
Familiarity with Selenium WebDriver automation tool
Ability to write automated tests for web applications
Understanding of web testing best practices
Knowledge of Git version control system
Test Cases
The following test cases are included in this project:

Register a new user
Login with valid credentials
Search for a doctor by name
Search for a doctor by specialty
Book an appointment with a doctor
Each test case is implemented as a TestNG test method and includes setup and teardown methods to ensure that the test environment is properly configured and cleaned up after each test.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

src/main/java: Contains the Java source code for the project
src/test/java: Contains the Java source code for the test cases
src/test/resources: Contains any test data or configuration files required by the test cases
Test Data
The test cases in this project require no additional test data. All necessary data is generated within the test cases.

Continuous Integration
This project is integrated with Travis CI, a popular continuous integration service. Whenever a new commit is pushed to the GitHub repository, Travis CI automatically builds and runs the test cases, and reports the results on the project's GitHub page.

Known Issues
There are currently no known issues with this project.

Future Plans
In the future, we plan to add additional test cases to cover more scenarios on the Vezeeta website, and to integrate the project with other testing tools and services, such as Sauce Labs and BrowserStack.
